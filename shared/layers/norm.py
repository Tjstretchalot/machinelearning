"""This module adds absolute norm layers which are meant to work in conjunction with batch norm
layers to allow a network which whitens between layers to still be evaluable when you don't have
a batch to calculate the sample mean and variance from. Note that while training you would still
want a batch norm so that the gradients reflect that the values are enforced to be zero-mean and
unit-variance, but this is not a necessary feature when evaluating the network.
